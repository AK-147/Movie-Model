  </ul>

  <h2>:file_folder: Contents</h2>
  <p>There are two files within the <strong>Main</strong> file:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Documents</strong> has detailed project deliverables such as reports and presentation slides.</li>
    <li><strong>Model</strong> contains the data scraping and model logic as <strong>.ipynb</strong> Python notebook files.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Google Colab</strong> was the main environment used to develop the model.</p>
  
  <h2>:warning: Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>
    Given that the raw code was not listed as part of the deliverables in the project and with a strict deadline, the cleanliness of
    it was not of high priority. As a result, most of the data collection and web scraping is organized in a minimalistic fashion with
    little explanation of the code. Additionally, this project was completed through collaboration as part of a team of four and their
    names have been replaced with their initials to keep them anonymous but still acknowledge their contributions. Their work and effort
    is greatly appreciated as this project would not have been possible otherwise.
